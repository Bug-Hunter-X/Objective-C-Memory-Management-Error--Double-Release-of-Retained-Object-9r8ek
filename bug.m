In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to object ownership and the `retain`/`release` (or `retainCount`) mechanisms.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// ...in some method...
MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
myObject.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
// ... later ...
[myObject release];
```

The issue lies in the double-release of `myString`.  `myObject` retains `myString` via the property's `retain` attribute.  When `myObject` is deallocated, `myString` is released.  However, the explicit `[[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];` also retains `myString`.  This means `myString` will be released twice, causing a crash or unexpected behavior.  This scenario is easily overlooked when dealing with multiple allocations and assignments.  Modern ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) greatly mitigates this, but understanding this underlying principle is critical when working with older Objective-C code or specific situations where ARC might not fully cover all nuances.
